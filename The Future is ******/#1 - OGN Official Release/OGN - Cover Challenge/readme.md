## Indentifying the Symbols.
There are many symbol ciphers out there, but how do we identify this one?

A popular website for identifying different types of ciphers is DCODE.

To identify which cipher it might be, we can compare the symbols against common ciphers listed on DCODE.

A sample of symbol ciphers from the above link:

The symbols closely resemble the PigPen cipher, a well-known substitution system that uses grids and shapes. Let’s decode it using DCODE’s PigPen tool.


## Using the PigPen Decoder on DCODE
Click on each Symbol in their Decoder (leaving out the . and / for now)

## Reconstructing the URL
Count the number of symbols before the . and then /

Then matching the number of letters to place the . and / appropriately

Results in: TFICOMIC.IO/BLEEDS

Type the URL into your browser and hit enter!
